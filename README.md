# Chess-Ai

This was my attempt to make a simple AI that plays chess. Many versions of the program were made and this is not the final version of it, but this is the one that worked the most reliably. However, the code is messy, theres almost no useful comments in it and it runs quite slowly so I may eventually give this another go one day.

# New AI is Here
